auto-install-peers = true

# Description by an LLM:
#This is an npm (Node Package Manager) configuration file named .npmrc. The specific setting shown here is:

#This configuration tells npm to automatically install peer dependencies when installing packages. A peer dependency is a dependency that a package needs but expects the consuming application to install.

#When this setting is true:

#npm will automatically install peer dependencies without requiring explicit installation
#This can help avoid "unmet peer dependency" warnings
#It saves developers time by not having to manually install peer dependencies
#This is particularly useful in modern JavaScript/TypeScript projects (like this Astro project) where many packages have peer dependencies on common libraries like React, TypeScript, or other core dependencies.

#Without this setting (or if set to false), you would need to manually install peer dependencies when npm warns you about them during package installation.
